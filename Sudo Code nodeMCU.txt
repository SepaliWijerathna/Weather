initialize sensors
try to extablish a connection to the server
loop1 :  collect sensor data
        pre proccess row sensor data (reject Outliers/Anomalies and other processing)
        loop2: loop for 15 times
            sum = sum + newSensorReading
            wait 1 minute
        
        AvgSensor Reading = sum/15
        read the EEPRom and get the saved sensor data
        Make the xml strings based on sensor and dates
        send the xml string to relevent end-points
        
        if(request is successful):
            clear the EEPRom
        else:
            save newly collected data on EEPRom
        goto loop1
